*** Disclaimer *** 

This is not an official Government Website about the Australian election ballot. 

There are about 5% of the total votes classified as Invalid votes because of a number of reasons. 

This website contains actual candidate information retreived from the official government website.

This website is designed to help voters see who are in their actual ballot paper and what it will look like on the day.

This website also help voters practice voting and prepare for the actual electrion.

Voters can practice filling out their ballot papers, or even take a screenshot of the practice vote and copy what they have decided/prepared to the actual ballots on the day.

*** Disclaimer *** 

The AEC (Australian Electoral Commission) has this page to view all the candidates for an upcoming election:
https://www.aec.gov.au/election/candidates.htm

The problem with that is that it's a flat wall of text which is kind of hard to navigate.

Wouldn't it be good if you could see a preview of what the actual ballot paper looked like for your area,
so that you can look at it and calmly decide where to put your vote before the polling booth?

That's what this tiny website does.
