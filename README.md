# australian-election-ballot

The AEC (Australian Electoral Commission) has this page to view all the candidates for an upcoming election:
https://www.aec.gov.au/election/candidates.htm

The problem with that is that it's a flat wall of text which is kind of hard to navigate.

Wouldn't it be good if you could see a preview of what the actual ballot paper looked like for your area,
so that you can look at it and calmly decide where to put your vote before the polling booth?

That's what this tiny website does.
