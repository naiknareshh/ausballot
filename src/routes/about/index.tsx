      <h4>Who built this?</h4>
      <p>
        Hey, my name is Robin and I'm a software developer from Sydney. You can
        find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/niborst">Twitter</a>!
      </p>
      <h4>Why did you build this?</h4>
      <p>
        Last time I went to the polling place, I remember being overwhelmed by
        the ballot papers (especially the senate) and not feeling prepared
        enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted a way to see what my ballot papers are going to look like and
        decide how to vote beforehand. The AEC website has a list of all the
        candidates, but it's very long and hard to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        I saw that the AEC provides CSV files with the candidate data, so I
        downloaded it and after a bit of coding ended up with this :).
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully by sharing this it can help others prepare for their vote as
        well!
      </p>
      <h4>Is this official?</h4>
      <p>
        No, it's not an official website, I just built this for fun and thought
        it might be helpful for people. Use at your own discretion.
      </p>
